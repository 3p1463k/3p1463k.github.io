This article is to demonstrate the process of making a simple shiny dashboard and plotting the data from csv file.

At the end of of the article i will also describe how to deploy the application on shinyapps.io.
Shiny apps and dasboards are using R language and they are fairly simple to make after you tackle the basis and understand the structure.

The application, i will be demonstrating here today is for plotting the data from the Nest thermostat. The Google provides you the data at Google Takeout, you can just download it from there. However Google doesnt provide any platform where you can see your data, except in the Nest app, which was not satisfying to me, so i decided to make my own plots.

All children, except one, grow up. They soon know that they will grow up, and the way Wendy knew was this. One day when she was two years old she was playing in a garden, and she plucked another flower and ran with it to her mother. I suppose she must have looked rather delightful, for Mrs. Darling put her hand to her heart and cried, "Oh, why can't you remain like this for ever!" This was all that passed between them on the subject, but henceforth Wendy knew that she must grow up. You always know after you are two. Two is the beginning of the end.
